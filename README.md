An application which loads several buildings at Western University and maps them, by floor, with different locations such as class rooms, washrooms, and restaurants.

There are several user accounts:
- In the admin account, the admin is able to add or remove points of interest (POIs) to a certain position in a floor in a building. These POIs show for all users.
- In a user's account, they can create POIs themselves, as well as remove those created by themselves. These POIs only show for the user signed in, and not for other users.

The app is created in Java and Swing, and was a class project with several other students.
